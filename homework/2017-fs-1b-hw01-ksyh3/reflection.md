Homework 1 - Unit Testing
=========================
I have done a lot of unit testing in the past for internships and ACM so I feel
the majority of the homework was fairly manageable. I did not find anything
particulary hard except for the disk 1. Originally, I did not realize that the
disk 1 was completely incorrect (the same as disk 2) so it took me a while to 
finally grasp the changes I needed to make.

Throughout this assignment, I learned a lot about unit testing in boost. The
only unit testing I have ever done is in python through various automated
testing libraries. The process of compiling and using the compiled files to
test the files as well as the .gcov files gave me a new unit testing 
perspective.
